# General Questions

## About Modding

### Something is broken/buggy.

Please go ahead [Report Issue/Feedback](issue-feedback.md) section.

If you're going to send me DM, please write what you need first.

Sending "hi" first is not going to help neither of us.

### I want to give you the report, but I don't know what's wrong.

You can ask me or anyone in [ILLUSION Discord](https://discord.gg/illusionsoft) #mod-creation channel for the problem you're having.

Still, the same rules apply. You need to provide the right amount of data to the modder to see and diagnose the problem you're having right now.

### Can I modify this project and call it a separate project?

Yes. You can do anything you want.

## About Workshop

### Do you make mods frequently?

Yes. I'm aiming to release a new mod every week. Sometimes some technical issues delay the schedule, but mostly it's on the weekly release schedule.

### How long is Early Access?

Early Access will last four weeks to 8 weeks. It depends on how the content is original.
The 'original' in this sentence means how many hand-made assets in the mod.

### Is there a Discord Server?

[Workshop Discord](https://discord.gg/vQkzH73)

## About me

### Do you take commissions?

Unfortunately, I don't take small commissions like making the outfit from other games or works. You can raise some bounty if you have an excellent idea that would help the HS2/AI community.

### How can I contact you?

I don't usually respond to DM unless it's urgent.

I usually present in [ILLUSION Discord](https://discord.gg/illusionsoft).

You can ping me from there or join [Workshop Discord](https://discord.gg/vQkzH73) to contact me.

If you need more serious contact, please send an e-mail to `hooh-hooah@protonmail.com`
