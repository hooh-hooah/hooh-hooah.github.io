# Reporting the Issues/Feedbacks

We all hate goblins. However, they keep manage to come and sneak under our beds.

In that case, you need to stop for a second and check if it's your mistake or my mistake.

When it's not your fault, you need to let people know something went wrong. 

## How to report Modding Tool Issue

If something is not working well in the Modding Tool, Please submit a ticket in [the GitHub Project Issues Tracker Page](https://github.com/IL-Modding-Tool/Modding-Tool-Unity-Package).

If you don't want to expose your identity, consider using third party e-mail accounts (Like [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com)) with un-traceable aliases.

## How to report Plugin Issue (For ALL BepinEx plugins)

Just one thing. **PLEASE ATTACH `output_log.txt` FILE with the Issues!**. If you don't attach `output_log.txt` file with the issues, The probability of getting the answer will get low as AAA lootboxes.

You can find the `output_log.txt` file in the root folder of the game   .

Also don't forget to attach the visual references such as Videos and Screenshots.

If I can't figure out what's wrong with your words, I simply can't fix the issues since I can't figure out what's wrong.
