Drag and drop your custom mod XML file into the mod builder's target window.

After setting the build target, check if the output path is where you desire to put your custom zipmod archive.

If everything is okay, validate your XML file if you didn't make any mistake inside the XML file.

Unless a mod packer cannot find an asset or has some issue while resolving the Asset Bundle's path, it says nothing.

It depends on your mod size, but it will play a nice sound to notify the packing is done after a few seconds or minutes.
