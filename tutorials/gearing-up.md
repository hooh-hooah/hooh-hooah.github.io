# Setting up Folder

Setting up a folder is the most crucial first step you're going to do in the processing of making a mod for HS2/AI.

Every mod for the game are consists of assets and data with no exception .

### Making a mod folder

Thus, creating an easy folder structure that anyone can understand is the first step.

Create any folder in the Assets folder in Unity Editor

### Create XML file

this XML file is the pillar of this modding tool. This XML file will contain all of the data of your mod.

You have a few options to create an XML file into your folder.

-   Creating by yourself
-   Using "Generate XML File"
-   Using "Template XML File"

I recommend using "Template XML File" if you have no idea what you're doing.

It might feel restrictive, but if you don't have any plan to read all documentation and learn the core of unity programming, it's okay to not think about anything in the trade of small nuisance.

### Creating Temporary Folder

Anyone has their organizing taste. But, for now, it's time to put that away for a few trials.

Since modding has many tasks, it is hard to read all of the documents to make the right file and folders in a limited time budget.

So, here is an excellent temporary tactic you can use: following the manual.

Create these folders below with no questions:

-   `prefabs`
-   `thumbs`
-   `assets`

### Validating your setup

If you followed the manual so far, You could see those files and folders in your custom mod folder.

-   `prefabs`
-   `thumbs`
-   `assets`
-   `mod.xml`

If you everything on the list in your folder, you're good to go! Now it's time to read other documents with an actual tutorial to create new content for HS2/AI!

Congrats! You're ready to be a new modder!
