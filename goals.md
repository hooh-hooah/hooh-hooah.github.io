# Goals and To-do

## The Project's Direction

My general objective for creating the modding tool is having full control over the game, which means giving full control for all of the modders from intermediate modders to advanced modder.

Also, our time is valuable. Even if the modding tool supports everything for the game, if it takes like a week to make a simple mod, That means something is wrong, and the modding tool is wasting everyone's time.

So, Automation is another main objective of this project.
