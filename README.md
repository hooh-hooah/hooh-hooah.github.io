# hooh's Modding Tool

## Welcome

Welcome to hooh's Modding Tool Tutorial Central!

You can learn how to make a mod for HS2/AI in one place. You don't have to ask people around where to learn modding anymore!

## Before doing something

This tutorial compilation currently does not covers all generic tutorials, such as generic blender tutorials or generic photoshop tutorials.

You need to understand how 3D Graphics and Unity Engine works to start HS2/AI modding.

## Contributing the modding community

### Translation

Since the docsify framework has a localization feature, I recommend translating this modding document to make your local community members join the modding community.

There is a localization folder in the repository. feel free to modify the document

### Adding New Tutorials

You can let other people know about your tips and generic tutorials. Feel free to add a new document to the repository.
You can add new tutorials in this [repository](https://github.com/hooh-hooah/hooh-hooah.github.io).
Unfortunately, All of the contributions will get moderated before they get applied to the website.

### Contributing Modding Tool Development

I'm always open to a new pull request. Still, the modding tool has a long way to go. I'd like to have someone who can help me improve the modding experience for everyone.
You can start development by cloning this [repository](https://github.com/hooh-hooah/ModdingTool).

### The most simple way

You can contribute to the modding community by sharing this document with everyone to let other people know they can add content to the game in a simpler way.

Even if you don't know how to mod or make new stuff, sharing this page to the newcomer is already a big contribution you can do!
